### Welcome aboard!

In this lecture, we will:

1. Briefly review the basics of recursive programming.
2. Solve two programming exercises using recursion.
3. Use those exercises to introduce the idea of _backtracking_.

There is an extra exercise at the end which we will leave as homework to you (please don't work on it during the lecture unless you are really bored :).
